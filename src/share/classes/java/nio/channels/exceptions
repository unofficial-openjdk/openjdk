SUPER=java.io.IOException

gen ClosedChannelException "
 * Checked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke or complete an
 * I/O operation upon channel that is closed, or at least closed to that
 * operation.  That this exception is thrown does not necessarily imply that
 * the channel is completely closed.  A socket channel whose write half has
 * been shut down, for example, may still be open for reading."

gen FileLockInterruptionException "
 * Checked exception received by a thread when another thread interrupts it
 * while it is waiting to acquire a file lock.  Before this exception is thrown
 * the interrupt status of the previously-blocked thread will have been set."


SUPER=ClosedChannelException

gen AsynchronousCloseException "
 * Checked exception received by a thread when another thread closes the
 * channel or the part of the channel upon which it is blocked in an I/O
 * operation."


SUPER=AsynchronousCloseException

gen ClosedByInterruptException "
 * Checked exception received by a thread when another thread interrupts it
 * while it is blocked in an I/O operation upon a channel.  Before this
 * exception is thrown the channel will have been closed and the interrupt
 * status of the previously-blocked thread will have been set."


SUPER=IllegalArgumentException

gen IllegalSelectorException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to register a channel
 * with a selector that was not created by the provider that created the
 * channel."

gen UnresolvedAddressException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke a network
 * operation upon an unresolved socket address."

gen UnsupportedAddressTypeException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to bind or connect
 * to a socket address of a type that is not supported."


SUPER=IllegalStateException

gen AlreadyConnectedException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to connect a {@link
 * SocketChannel} that is already connected."

gen ConnectionPendingException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to connect a {@link
 * SocketChannel} for which a non-blocking connection operation is already in
 * progress."

gen ClosedSelectorException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke an I/O
 * operation upon a closed selector."

gen CancelledKeyException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to use
 * a selection key that is no longer valid."

gen IllegalBlockingModeException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when a blocking-mode-specific operation
 * is invoked upon a channel in the incorrect blocking mode."

gen NoConnectionPendingException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when the {@link SocketChannel#finishConnect
 * finishConnect} method of a {@link SocketChannel} is invoked without first
 * successfully invoking its {@link SocketChannel#connect connect} method."

gen NonReadableChannelException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to read
 * from a channel that was not originally opened for reading."

gen NonWritableChannelException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to write
 * to a channel that was not originally opened for writing."

gen NotYetBoundException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke an I/O
 * operation upon a server socket channel that is not yet bound."

gen NotYetConnectedException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke an I/O
 * operation upon a socket channel that is not yet connected."

gen OverlappingFileLockException "
 * Unchecked exception thrown when an attempt is made to acquire a lock on a
 * region of a file that overlaps a region already locked by the same Java
 * virtual machine, or when another thread is already waiting to lock an
 * overlapping region of the same file."
